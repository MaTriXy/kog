# Notes on Contributing

Any and all feedback is welcome. Just open an issue, even if it's only
to ask a question.

I also idle in kotlin's Slack group under the username `danneu`. 

While I use kog in some small projects, much of kog isn't field-tested
beyond kog's test suite. There's a lot of low-hanging fruit, and I
generally discover issues and flesh out functionality on a just-in-time,
as-needed basis.

I'm always open to reimplementation ideas as well if an existing
abstraction is not flexible enough.

All of this also applies to kog's supporting (extracted) libraries:
